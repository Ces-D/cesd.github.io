## Key Words
### _macros_ 
### _cargo_
Rust's build system and package manager. Handles tasks such building code, downloading libraries, and building the libraries.
__Commands__
- `cargo new <dir>`
- `cargo init`

After running either of the above commands. You should see a `Cargo.toml` file. 
```
[package]
name = "learning_rust"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
```

Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far about Cargo:

- We can create a project using cargo new.
- We can build a project using cargo build.
- We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run.
- We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.
- Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.
