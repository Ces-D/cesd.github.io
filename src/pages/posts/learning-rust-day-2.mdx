Rust variables are immutable by default. We must add the `mut` keyword before the variable name to indicate mutability.

The `let mut guess = Strong::new();` has created a mutable variable that is bound to a new and empty instance of a `String`.

```rust
use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");
    println!("Input yout guess.");
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    loop {
        let mut guess = String::new();
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small! - {secret_number}"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big! - {secret_number}"),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `&` indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one pieve of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times. References are immutable by default, hence, why we need to write `&mut guess` rather than `&guess` to make it mutable. If we did not include the `expect` method, the application would have compiled with a warning. The warning would let us know that the `Result` value returned by `read_line` has not handled a possible error. The right way to suppress the warning is to write error handling, but in this case we are crashing the program when a problem occurs, hence `expect`. `Ok` and `Err` are two functions that handle the two cases of either success or failure when dealing with possible errors. `.parse` returns a `Result` enum and this enum allows us to specify the variants `Ok` and `Err`. We have _shadowed_ the variable `guess`, meaing that we are able to reuse a variable name.
