### Digestive health

Bananas contain water and fiber, both of which promote regularity and encourage digestive health. One medium banana provides approximately 10% of a person's fiber needs for a day.

Bananas are also part of an approach known as the [BRAT dietTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538142/), which some doctors recommend for treating [diarrhea](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158634.php "What you should know about diarrhea"). BRAT stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast.

Diarrhea can lead to a loss of water and electrolytes, such as potassium. Bananas can replace these nutrients.

High fiber foods can trigger bloating, gas, and stomach cramps in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), according to a 2012 [studyTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/22923336/). However, bananas may improve symptoms, the authors concluded.

The [Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/pdfs/diet-nutrition-2013.pdf) recommend banana as a snack food in their diet plan.

### Preserving memory and boosting mood

Bananas [containTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4728667/) tryptophan, an amino acid that may help preserve memory, boost a person's ability to learn and remember things, and regulate mood.

Potassium

______________________________________________________________________

Bananas are rich in the mineral potassium. Potassium [helps maintainTrusted Source](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/) fluid levels in the body and regulates the movement of nutrients and waste products in and out of cells.

Potassium also helps muscles to contract and nerve cells to respond. It keeps the heart beating regularly and can reduce the effect of sodium on blood pressure.

Potassium may reduce the risk of [kidney stones](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154193.php "How do you get kidney stones?") forming as people age. In turn, healthy kidneys make sure that the right amount of potassium stays in the body.

One medium sized banana contains [422 milligramsTrusted Source](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/341529/nutrients) (mg) of potassium.

It is best to try to get potassium from dietary sources, such as bananas. Otherwise, potassium supplements are available to purchase online.
